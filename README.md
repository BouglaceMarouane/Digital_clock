# Digital clock
Creating a digital clock with Python and PyQt was a great learning experience for me. It gave me hands-on practice with building GUIs, updating the interface in real-timeusing QTimer, and understanding how event-driven programming works. I also got better at managing code structure and working with date and time functions. This project wasn’t just about writing code—it helped me think through problems and find efficient solutions. Sharing it on GitHub is a way for me to document my progress and keep improving my Python and GUI development skills.
